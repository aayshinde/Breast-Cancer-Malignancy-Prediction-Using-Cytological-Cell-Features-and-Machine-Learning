# AI Usage Statement

This project used AI tools (ChatGPT) as a supportive assistant. The following tasks involved AI assistance:

## ✔ What AI Helped With
- Suggesting how to organize the machine learning pipeline  
- Helping write sections of the project proposal and README  
- Providing example snippets for model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing  
- Suggesting improvements when code was slow or inefficient  
- Explaining bioinformatics concepts in simpler words

## ✔ What I Did Myself
- Implemented, edited, and verified all code  
- Ran the notebook end-to-end and resolved errors  
- Performed all analysis and interpretation of results  
- Selected the final models, parameters, visuals, and conclusions  
- Ensured biological meaning and correctness

## ✔ Reproducibility
All results can be reproduced using the provided notebook and dataset.  
AI tools did not perform any analysis — only provided guidance.
